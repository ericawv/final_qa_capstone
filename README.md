Hi! Thank you for visiting the demonstration of my Bright Paths QA Specializations Capstone Project. This project hightlights the manual and automated testing techniques and process for testing both the Hyundai USA and Universal Orlando Resort USA websites. In addition to testing the Hyundai USA and Universal Orlando Resort USA websites, API testing was also executed against the Marvel, Trello, and Universal Orlando Resort websites.
